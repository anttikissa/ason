- change all ids to strings then tokenizing
later, when error messages are being printed, we know which character the token
came from and can retokenize it from there as printable (not sure if this idea
is any good or not)

- should combine eof checks?

- should remove repeating code

- should consolidate next = peek(), somewhere

- should have eat(something) and maybeEat(something), perhaps named 'expect'

- grunt build that removes logs

- travis CI?
